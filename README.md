# simple-query-selector

Very simple query-selector for e.g. XML and HTML documents.
It uses symfony `CssSelector` in order to make jQuery-like
queries on a DOM-tree. `CssSelector` rewrites xpath expressions
to CSS-selectors, which for most web-developers are much easier
to understand and work with. Css-selectors is also what e.g. jQuery
uses, which then makes it familiar to almost any web-developer. 

The `query-selector` class just wraps the functionality of 
the `CssSelector`.
